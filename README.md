## Prepare

You need to install the Xcode developer tools on a brand new system in order to have git.

`xcode-select --install`

## Installation

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hathaway/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles;
# run this using terminal (not iTerm, lest iterm settings get discarded on exit)
./bootstrap.sh
```
